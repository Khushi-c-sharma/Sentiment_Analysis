# Sentiment_Analysis

This project involves conducting sentiment analysis using the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset available on Kaggle. Three main techniques have been employed to analyze the sentiments:

# VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)
# RoBERTa Model (A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach)
# Transformer Pipeline

Techniques Used
1. VADER
VADER is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media. It is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion.

2. RoBERTa Model
RoBERTa, which stands for A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach, is an advanced version of BERT. It is designed to improve the performance of sentiment analysis by optimizing the training approach and using larger batches for training.

3. Transformer Pipeline
The Transformer Pipeline leverages the power of transformer-based models to perform sentiment analysis. This technique is highly effective due to its capability to understand context and nuances in natural language.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset from Kaggle. It contains a large number of reviews along with ratings, which provide a rich source for sentiment analysis.
